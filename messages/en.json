            "description": "I was responsible for the web production of Bandai's capsule toy, \"Gashapon<span>&reg;</span>,\" and its official information site, the \"Gashapon<span>&reg;</span> Official Site.\" By integrating sales data transmitted from Gashapon<span>&reg;</span> machines with users' location information, I implemented a feature that allows users to easily search on a map for where they can purchase their desired products. This enhancement significantly improved the functionality of the information site. Additionally, by linking the official external online shop, \"Gashapon<span>&reg;</span> Online,\" with the sales data in near real-time, I established a seamless pathway for users to make purchases as soon as they find the products they want. As a result, approximately 13% of the total sales from the online shop were generated from referrals through this site.",

            "description": "I was responsible for the web direction of the official information site for plastic models manufactured and sold by BANDAI SPIRITS, called the \"Bandai Hobby Site.\" Due to the growing popularity of the site, there were frequent instances where the server could not handle the heavy traffic, leading to users being unable to view pages during peak times. To address this, I initiated the migration to a cloud server, which could be easily upgraded to handle expected traffic surges. Before the migration, the site experienced tens of thousands of 503 (service unavailable) errors per hour during peak times, but after the switch to the cloud server, these errors were completely eliminated. I successfully established a robust environment that ensures the server remains operational even during critical periods when downtime is not an option.",

To raise awareness about crime prevention, a design competition was held by the Nakamura Police Station in Aichi Prefecture and McDonald's Japan. I was awarded an Excellence Award in this competition and, following a public vote, received the Grand Prize. My design was used as a tray mat in McDonald's stores in the Tokai region. In recognition of my contribution to crime prevention awareness, I received a certificate of appreciation from the Nakamura Police Station and was appointed as a one-day police station chief.",
