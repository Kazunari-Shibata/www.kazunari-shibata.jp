            "description": "Responsible for web production of Bandai's capsule toy \"Gashapon<span>&reg;</span>\" official information site, \"Gashapon<span>&reg;</span> Official Site.\" Implemented a feature that combines sales data sent from Gashapon<span>&reg;</span> machines with users' location information, allowing users to easily search for where they can buy their desired products on a map, thereby enhancing the site's performance as an information resource. Additionally, by linking sales data with the external official online shop \"Gashapon<span>&reg;</span> Online\" in almost real-time, streamlined the process for users to make immediate purchases once they find the products they want. As a result, the site was able to drive approximately 13% of the total sales of the online shop."

            "description": "I was responsible for web direction for the official information site \"Bandai Hobby Site,\" which provides details on plastic models manufactured and sold by BANDAI SPIRITS Inc. Due to the recent surge in popularity, there were frequent instances where the server couldn't handle the high traffic, causing the site to be inaccessible. To address this, I spearheaded the migration to a cloud server, which allows for easier upgrades to server specifications in anticipation of heavy traffic. Before the migration, tens of thousands of 503 (Service Unavailable) errors occurred per hour during peak times, but after the move to the cloud server, this number dropped to zero. This ensured that we could create an environment where we were fully prepared to handle situations where server downtime was absolutely unacceptable."

To raise awareness about crime prevention, a competition for tray mats was held by the Nakamura Police Station of Aichi Prefecture and Japan McDonald's, which is active in community contributions. I won the grand prize in this competition. The tray mats were used in all McDonald's locations across the Tokai region, significantly contributing to the eradication of the JK Business, and I received a letter of appreciation from the Aichi Prefectural Police."
